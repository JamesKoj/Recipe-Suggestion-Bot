        <h4>How it works?</h4>
        <div>This Recipe bot uses Google's Natural Language Processing platform, Dialogflow, and picks up on key phrases in the conversation to suggest tasty (in our opinion!) recipes. It uses Dialogflow intents and events to simulate a natural conversation with the user. The Recipe chatbot is a work in progress and will continue to be updated.</div>
